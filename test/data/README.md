It includes a reading of the so-called ["Harvard Sentences"](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/audio/harvard.html) (List 1).

1. Glue the sheet to the dark blue background.
1. It's easy to tell the depth of a well.
1. These days a chicken leg is a rare dish.
1. Rice is often served in round bowls.

1. The box was thrown beside the parked truck.
1. The hogs were fed chopped corn and garbage.
1. Four hours of steady work faced us.

The transcription is close, but does not precisely match the source sentences.
